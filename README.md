# 📄 **Description**

# **Level 1**

# Level 3

## Exercise 1 – Spotify🎵

We will create a simple model of the database required for **Spotify**.

This document outlines the requirements for a simplified Spotify database model.

Core Entities:

- Users: Can be Free or Premium. Stored data includes ID, email, password, username, date of birth, gender, country, and postal code.

- Subscriptions: For premium users, including start/renewal dates and payment method (Credit Card or PayPal). All payment history (date, order number, amount) is recorded.

- Playlists: Created by users, with a title, song count, ID, and creation date. Deleted playlists are marked as such (not removed) and given a deletion date. Active playlists can be shared, tracking which user added a song and when.

- Music Catalog: Includes Songs (title, duration, plays), Albums (title, release year, cover), and Artists (name, image). A song belongs to one album, and an album belongs to one artist, who can have many albums.

Relationships:

    A user can follow many artists.

    Artists can be related to other artists.

    A user can mark songs and albums as favorites.

Final Note: The database must be populated with test data to verify all relationships.
